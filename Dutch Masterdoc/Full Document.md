List of Monthly Expenses
Bills TOTAL: 969,60
- Energy Bill: 157,- (Clean Energy B.V.)
    - Notes: you have two types of contract, “vast” and “flexibel”. “Vast” means a fixed price you pay every month, and is the safer one. “Flexibel” means your cost changes depending on the price, which means if it’s lower you save money but if it’s higher you will pay more. Considering the price is only going up, flexible contracts have no benefit. I highly recommend having a fixed contract so you have predictable costs. I don’t know if this will ever apply to you, but apparently some companies will not have contracts if you have solar energy panels, so be aware of that I guess. 
- Water: 12,- (Vitens NV)
- Rent: 547,95 for 42m² (Veen Vesters)
    - Notes: Obviously I have limited experience and only in social housing, but rent can get really expensive fast depending on where you live. I live in a city without universities/college, and I would not call Veenendaal a destination city. Please look [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cGFJ7fSZ_NFa2OkhHWj8xf5jsTShpyTx0ZFWn2TwLBs/edit?pli=1&tab=t.qdxqn3mkaayj) for an explanation and links to the Dutch government site where I got my info. 
- Health Insurance: 159,99 (OHRA Zorgverzekering)
    - Notes: you are required to have basic health insurance which covers GP visits, ambulance transport and hospital stays. You can then add things(called additional insurance) like dentists (YEAH THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED BASIC HEALTH), physiotherapy etc. depending on your needs and expectations (this does cost more). There is a period every year where you can switch health insurance (13 november-31 december) but there are exceptions, such as immigrating so this won’t apply for your first year! But worth noting for the future anyway.
- GBLT: 13,09 (This is a weird one)
    - Notes: this is waterschapsbelasting, “waterschap” is a name for a type of area based around waterworks like rivers. This is a collection of taxes that goes two ways: waterschap aka water works, and gemeenten aka municipalities. For the waterworks side, it allows for maintenance of dykes, sewers etc. and for the municipalities side you can think of infrastructure like roads, or help for lower income people. You get this bill once per year, but you can split up the payments monthly which is what I have to even out the costs. Hence why this is in the monthly bills, but you can make it a one time payment if you want.
- Mobile Plan: 22,14 (KPN)
- Internet: 57,43 (KPN)
    - Notes: I’m putting these directly together because they’re the same provider, often you can get mobile/internet/tv bundles (I don’t have TV) and that might save you some money, but it’s nice either way to only have to deal with one provider. Also these are from this month, but mobile can be more depending on data you use etc.

DUTCH RENTING SYSTEM INFO AND LINKS
- So let’s start with the basics. There’s two ways of renting: social housing, which is always done by corporations or associations. This means lower rent limits, but also waiting lists and lower quality housing. Then there’s private renting, called “particulier” because you rent from a landlord, not a corporation. Your options in housing are more varied and bigger, with more amenities etc. but also higher rent limits. You also don’t have to go on wait lists, you can make a contract whenever you see fit.
- There’s 3 “types” of residences that are being rented (I don’t know official english counterpart names for them, so bear with me as I make up english translations for them): social housing (“sociale huurwoning”), middle housing (“middenhuurwoning”), and free sector housing (“vrijesectorwoning”). These are determined by a points system (I linked the graph below), and in turn determine what your limit of rent pricing is.
- The points system is determined by things like surface area in square meters, energy use/waste, worth of the residence (this is determined by the government) etc. There’s separate pointing counts per type of residence (think apartments vs single rooms vs trailer park).
- The biggest differences between these that you need to know is that social housing and middle housing have rent limits set by the government, and free sector housing does not. So basically you will be renting from a landlord, and the type of residence (the listing HAS to have points information included) will determine if you have a rent limit, and what the maximum of rent is.
- Social housing doesn’t apply here (only available to yearly incomes lower than 46,000,-).
- Middle housing has a rent maximum of 1184,82 (2025).
- Free sector housing has extra rules that apply to contracts before certain times (2024) but those don’t apply to you, so there’s no rent maximum and the landlord can determine how much to charge.
- Important to note is that the maximum rent limits are without things like amenities, this is pure building rent. So you can pay more for service, potential gas/electricity etc.
